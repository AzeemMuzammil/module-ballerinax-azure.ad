Azure Active Directory(AD) is Microsoftâ€™s multi-tenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service. It provides capabilities to enable Single Sign-On (SSO), multi-factor authentication, self-service password reset, privileged identity management, role-based access control, etc., to first and third-party Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.

Azure AD Connector allows you to perform operations on users and groups in an Azure AD using the v1.0 version of Microsoft Graph API. The client supports OAuth 2.0 authentication.
